Think of a ladder where people lcan move up and down in class through preferences and the longer they stay in that rung, the more like their neighbors they'll become. Idea that people will have their own undirected graphs and others are able to access those resources through an extenditure. 

1. Have people start with starting stats and my hypothesis will be that the population distribution in each level will look like a pyramid
    - maybe I weight the attributes differently
    - distribute the stats according to a normal distribution model/wealth distribution in the United States
    - first assign people to their class based on a normal distribution and then upper/lower of that class with a bias towards lower

2. Translate those stats into a graph with a total score that correlates

3. The more time that they spend in those rungs with people, they start to become nodes in their networks and their resource cost for accessing reduces

4. The grammar will be in how different types of people will traverse networks depending on their personalities (frame out of Bridges out of Poverty)

Hypothesis:
    Being in poverty means that you don't have many connections, that your network is shallow, or your network costs alot to access.
    Being not in poverty means that you have lots of connections, that your network is deep, or you network doesn't cost alot to access.

Resources:
    Financial: money to purchase goods and services
    Emotional: ability to choose and control emotional responses, particularly to negative situation, without engaging in self-destructive behavior. internal resource and shows through stamina, perseverance, and choices
    Mental: the mental abilities and acquired skills (reading, writing, computing) to deal with daily life. includes coping strategies, which are the mindsets, approaches, and techniques to move from the concrete to the abstract
    Language: the vocabulary, language ability, and negotiation skills to negotiate the environments necessary to build resources
    Social Capital: bonding capital (connections with people similar to yourself) and bridging captial (connections with people different from yourself). This includes friends, acquaintances, family, et al. and keeps one from being socially isolated.
    Health: health problems you have are managed and do not interfere with your ability to work and be self-sufficient. You have access to culturally competent healthcare providers.
    Spiritual: Believing in divine purpose and that you are part of something larger than yourself.
    Integrity and trust: Having the ability to keep your word, honoring the laws that govern you, and making decisions based on high ethical standards. it is equally important to be able to trust others to act with integrity. integrity and trust allow one to operate ethically without supervision.
    Motivation and persistene: connected to resiliency, the willingness to try, and the courage, stamina, and fortitude to work toward a goal.
    Relationships/role models: frequent access to adults who are nurturing and caring and who do not engage in self-destructive behavior. Having friends, family, and backup resources available to access in times of need. These are external resources.
    Knowledge of hidden rules: Knowing the unspoken cues and habits of a group

Vocabulary:
    triadic closure: Three people are likely to have a connection to each other if two are already closely associated
    ego network: someone is the center of their own network
    poverty trap: cycle of poverty due to self-reinforcing factors unless disrupted by external interventions
    mimicking (sociologist perspective): 
        modeling: where people reproduce behaviors seen in others, especially when these behaviors are seen as successful or rewarded.
        social stratification: where individuals or groups imitate the behaviors of higher-status groups in order to increase their own social standing
        symbolic interactionism: a key way in which individuals interpret and make sense of social interactions.
